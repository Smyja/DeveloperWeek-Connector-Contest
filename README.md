## Guidelines

Read [here](GUIDELINES.md) for all the rules about the contest and a checklist on connector requirements.

## Prizes

For every connector you create and have approved:
* **Low-Code CDK/Connector Builder UI**: $400 for every approved PR
* **First Place**:  $1,000  (we must be able to reproduce it)
* **Second Place**: $500

There is no limit on how many connectors one individual can submit, but teams that submit a connector will only receive one prize per connector. You can only work on one connector issue at a time. To clarify, you will be paid for each accepted entry!

## Requirements
* Must be merged by April 27th, 2023
* Must follow the [checklist](GUIDELINES.md) for all requirements.
* Must have proper documentation for Getting Started and usage.
* Must include a sandbox account for integration tests.

## Restrictions
Certain connectors may be restricted from this contest based on their already in-progress work or in-house requirements that need to be fulfilled. Make sure to get affirmation or acknowledgement before starting work on a connector for the contest.
